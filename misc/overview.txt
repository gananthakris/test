The course will describe the interface to a modern OS (Linux).  It
will require advanced C programming (the first few weeks of the course
will be spent on teaching C).  There will be 5 projects some of
which will build on each other: 1) A program using standard C; 2)
Anonymous pipes; 3) Named pipes with daemon; 4) Shared memory. 5)
Network multi-threaded programming.  The first 4 projects will be
individual projects; the last project will be done in a group of 2
students.  There will also be 4-5 homework assignments, pop quizzes,
midterm + final.
