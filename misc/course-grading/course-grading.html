      <div><section data-level="h1"><h1>CS 551:   Course Grading</h1><p>The following should be regarded as merely <em>guidelines</em> rather than
hard-and-fast rules.
</p><p>The following guidelines apply to grading both homeworks and projects:
</p><ul><li><p>The grading should be as consistent as possible:
</p><ol><li><p>For each assignment, between different students.
</p></li><li><p>Between different assignments, though that is less important than
         (1).
</p></li></ol></li><li><p>To help achieve consistency, it may be a good idea to hold off on
    completing grading, until the late submission deadline has passed.  Of
    course, end-of-semester and other deadlines may preclude this.
</p></li><li><p>For what seem to be minor problems, 1/2 a point can be taken off.
    However, when the overall assignment grade is recorded it should be
    rounded up to the nearest integer.
</p></li><li><p>The guidelines given here are not inviolate and can be violated when it
    makes sense to do so.
</p></li></ul><section data-level="h3"><h3>Exam and Homework Grading Guidelines</h3><ul><li><p>Not all homework/exam questions have exactly one answer; in fact,
    some homeworks questions may be vague, intentionally or sometimes
    unintentionally.  The student's answer to such questions should be
    graded against what the question (and any clarifications made to
    it) actually specifies and not only by comparison with the
    provided solution.  For such questions, the provided solution may
    be only one of many possible solutions.
</p></li><li><p>It is the student's obligation to ensure that work turned in is
    readable by any average person. A grader should not feel
    obligated to decipher illegible scribblings.
</p></li><li><p>It is the student's obligation to clearly indicate which answers are
    canceled; if there are multiple answers to the same question, then only
    the last answer should be graded.
</p></li><li><p>A reasonable answer should get at least 50% of the maximum points for
    that question.
</p></li><li><p>If the language or style used in an assignment is inconsistent,
    you should be suspicious.  Often web searches may be used to find
    sources which the student copied without citing them, which
    constitutes cheating.
</p></li><li><p>If a question is marked <code>[RECORD]</code>, then the grader should
    record the grade obtained for that question individually for each
    student.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h3"><h3>Project Grading Guidelines</h3><ul><li><p>A project may be submitted multiple times before the project submission
    deadline.  Only the last submission should be graded.
</p></li><li><p>If a project does not<code> </code> &quot;compile &quot;, the student should usually get no more
    than 65%.  Depending on how complete the project is, it may get
    appreciably less.  In this case, it is useful to look for README or
    other files the student may have enclosed explaining the status of his
    or her project.
</p><p>    If it doesn't compile because it appears to be missing a file,
    then the grader <strong>may</strong> attempt to contact the student by email.
    However, the grader has no obligation to do so, since it is entirely
    the student's responsibility to ensure that a submission is
    complete.
</p></li><li><p>If a project compiles and passes all its runtime tests it should be
    guaranteed at least 90% assuming it has met <strong>all</strong> aspects of the project
    specification.  Note that this does not imply that a project which fails
    a single test cannot get more than 90%.
</p></li><li><p>The remaining 10% should be a judgement call on the grader's part.
    Things like the following:
</p><ul><li><p>Quality of code.  Is it modular?  Does it exhibit cut-and-paste reuse
        rather than reuse using programming constructs?
</p><p>	If a reader cannot understand the code because the code logic
        is convoluted with assignments to the same variable
        interspersed in complex control flow, then that is often an
        indication of poor code quality.
</p><p>        5-10 points may be taken off for particularly egregious submissions.
</p></li><li><p>Is it well-commented?  Note that the important point is that
        the program should be easily understandable and not that it
        meet some bureaucratic guidelines that every function have
        comments in such-and-such form.  Also note that a program
        understandable on its own with minimal or even no comments is
        preferable to a convoluted program which needs heavy
        commenting to explain its convolutions.
</p></li><li><p>Is it over-commented?  Does it exhibit the  <code class="hljs language-javascript">i++; /* increment i */</code>
        syndrome?
</p></li><li><p>Consistency of formatting and naming conventions.  No
        particular style is mandated as we all have our favorites.
        The consistency though is important and IMHO a important
        indicator of how well crafted the program may be.  5-10 points
        may be taken off for particularly egregious submissions.
</p></li><li><p>Are there unnecessary fixed limits built into the code?  Are
        there arrays declared with a fixed size which does not
        naturally follow from the problem domain?
</p></li><li><p>Are there magic numbers hardwired into code rather than being
        referenced via symbolic names.  This is such an egregious
        violation of good programming practice that even a single
        violation can be penalized by taking off 5 points.
</p></li><li><p>Does the project use the method(s) and algorithm(s) specified
        in the assignment.  If not, you can take off much more than
        15%, depending on how far off the project went from the spirit
        of the assignment.
</p></li></ul><p>    Violations of such subjective best practices in earlier projects
    should result in low penalties (say 1 to 2 points).  This can be
    increased to up to 10 points if egregious violations persist into
    the later projects.
</p></li><li><p>The grader should usually merely be glancing at the code.  If a test case
    has failed, then an attempt may be made to try finding out what caused
    it to fail, but usually it would be unreasonable to spend more than a
    couple of minutes on it.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2><p>If the grader detects a case of academic dishonesty, then the
instructor should be alerted and provided with documentation
supporting the case for academic dishonesty.  The grader should return
the assignment to the student with normal grading, without any
allegations about the alleged dishonesty.  The instructor will
evaluate the supporting documentation and decide whether the situation
amounts to an unambiguous case of academic dishonesty.
</p><p>Any attempt to &quot;fake<code></code>&quot; provided tests should be regarded as
academic dishonesty 
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Returning Graded Work</h2><p>Graded work should be returned to students, <strong>usually within 2 weeks
after the late submission deadline</strong>.  Besides the points obtained, the
graded work should also include indications of why points were lost.
</p><p>The returned material should contain at least the following:
</p><ol class="ol-letter"><li><p>The overall grade (and breakup if applicable).
</p></li><li><p>Log of the compilation (if applicable).
</p></li><li><p>Some description of the test case(s) used along with inputs and 
    expected outputs.
</p></li><li><p>Log of the program execution.
</p></li><li><p>Rubrics used in determining the grade.
</p></li></ol></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Recording Grades</h2><p>All grades should be published to students via brightspace (if the
assignment is graded using gradescope, then use the link to
brightspace to publish the gradescope grade to brightspace).  Since
brightspace is not capable of performing the computations needed for
determining the overall grade, please <strong>use Google Sheets to maintain
a master copy</strong> of the grades for the class.  Use automated ways of
synchronizing the Google sheet with the grades published on
brightspace.
</p><p>It is important to ensure that the spreadsheet distinguishes between
assignments which were not turned in and those for which a zero grade
was obtained.  The former should not be used in computing course
statistics whereas the latter should be used.
</p><p>Each assignment or exam should use a separate auxiliary sheet within
the spreadsheet. This sheet should record the overall grade for the
assignment as well as the details of how that grade was determined.
</p><p>There should be a master sheet which contains all grades for the
entire class, with a separate column dedicated to each assignment or
exam.  The master sheet should be set up to automatically update from
the auxiliary sheets recording the grades for individual assignments
or exams.  The update process should be based on student ID's where a
student should be identified by the prefix before the <code>@</code> in their BU
email address.
</p><p>For example, the following Google sheet formula can be used on the master
sheet to copy
a student's grade from a <code>Project 1</code> auxiliary sheet:
</p><pre>=iferror(vlookup(E6, 'Project 1'!A:E,5,false), &quot;&quot;)
</pre><ul><li><p><code>E6</code> is the cell in the master sheet containing the student's ID.
</p></li><li><p><code>'Project 1'!A:E</code> specifies the column search range within the
    auxiliary sheet where <code>vlookup()</code> looks for a matching student ID.
</p></li><li><p><code>5</code> specifies offset of the column containing the grade within
    the above search range.
</p></li><li><p><code>false</code> specifies that the auxiliary sheet is not sorted.
</p></li><li><p>The <code>iferror(vlookup(...), &quot;&quot;)</code> specifies that the result should
    be an empty string if there is a <code>vlookup</code> error (typically, the
    <code>E6</code> student ID is not found within the auxiliary sheet search
    range).
</p></li></ul><p>The master sheet should contain a column containing the overall grade
for each student based on the assigned weights mentioned in the
syllabus, except that it should not drop any grades.  This provides a
snapshot of a student's performance as the course progresses.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Accreditation Requirements</h2><p>For accreditation purposes, it is sometimes necessary to track the
work done by students.  Specifically, if a question on a homework or
exam is marked <code>[RECORD]</code>, then the grader <strong>must</strong> record the grade
obtained for that question individually for each student.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Assignment of Final Grades</h2><p>Letter grades will be assigned strictly monotonically based on the overall
grades with major input from the grader(s).  If at all possible, students whose
overall grades differ by a very tiny amount will receive the same letter
grade.
</p><p>Assignment of final grades will be done during a meeting after all
work has been graded.  For this meeting, the grader should ensure that
the master sheet within the google spreadsheet contains a summary of
grades for each assignment/exam for all students (details of grades
for individual assignments can be on other sheets).  Headings on the
summary sheet should be fixed so that they are always visible as the
content of the sheet are scrolled.  This should also be done for rows
with aggregates so that grades can be sorted without moving the
aggregates.
</p><p>This sheet should contain the following columns:
</p><ol><li><p>Two columns for the student name titled <code>Last Name</code>, <code>First Name</code>
    containing the student's name as provided by brightspace.
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the students ID (the prefix of their BU email address
    before the <code>@</code>) titled <code>userId</code>.
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the students B-number titled <code>bNumber</code>.
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the grade for each project assigned titled
    <code>prj</code><em>N</em> for <em>N</em> in 1, 2...
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the grade for for each homework assigned
    titled <code>hw</code><em>N</em> for <em>N</em> in 1, 2...
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the grade for each quiz assigned <code>qz</code><em>N</em> for
    <em>N</em> in 1, 2...
</p></li><li><p>A single column for each exam titled <code>mid</code> and <code>fin</code>.
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the overall project grade out of 100, titled
    <code>prjAvg</code> with lowest project dropped as per the course grading
    policy. 
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the overall homework grade out of 100, titled
    <code>hwAvg</code> with lowest homework dropped as per the course grading
    policy.
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the overall quiz grade, titled <code>qzAvg</code> with
    lowest quiz dropped as per the course grading policy.
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the overall course grade out of 100 titled
    <code>total</code> weighted as per the weights specified in the
     <a href="../../slides/syllabus/syllabus.html#weights">course syllabus</a>.
</p></li><li><p>A single column for the assigned letter grade titled <code>grade</code>.
    This column will be completed during the meeting.
</p></li><li><p>A single column titled <code>notes</code> containing miscellaneous notes
    for the student's letter grade, including any explanation for
    reduction of the grade caused by cheating.
</p></li></ol><p>There should be a row for each student with the rows set up in
alternating colors so that they are easy to scan.  These rows should
be sorted in descending order by the <code>total</code> column.
</p><p>All averages / totals should be rounded to 1 decimal position.
</p><p>Additionally, there should be rows at the top of the master sheet
giving the following aggregates for each individual column:
</p><ol class="ol-letter"><li><p>Number submitted titled <code>Number</code>.  
</p></li><li><p>Maximum grade titled <code>Maximum</code>.
</p></li><li><p>Average grade titled <code>Average</code>.  This should not count students who
    did not submit.
</p></li><li><p>Minimum grade titled <code>Minimum</code>. This should not count students who
    did not submit.
</p></li></ol><p>The above aggregate rows and <code>First Name</code> and <code>Last Name</code> columns
should be frozen so that it is possible to scroll the rest of the
sheet while keeping the frozen entries visible. 
</p><p>The columns should be resized to be as narrow as possible (use the
fit-to-data option provided by Google sheets).  During the meeting,
the <code>userId</code> and <code>bNumber</code> columns should be hidden as typically, they
will not be needed to enter the letter grades.
</p><p>During the meeting, the cutoffs used will be recorded in the
spreadsheet, possibly on a separate sheet.  These cutoffs should not
be provided to students to avoid attempts by some students to game the
system if they are close to a cut-off.
