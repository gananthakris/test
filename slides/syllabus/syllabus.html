</p><ul><li><p>Documentation typo fix: 0.5 points.
</p></li><li><p>Documentation update: 1 point.
</p></li><li><p>Code update: 1-3 points.
</p></li></ul><p>In order to obtain the extra credit:
</p><ul><li><p>Verify whether the open source project and proposed changes
    qualify by sending me a brief email.
</p></li><li><p>Send me a link to the pull request or any relevant emails which prove
    that your contribution was accepted.
</p></li><li><p>The contribution must be made <strong>during this semester</strong> and <strong>before the
    last week of class</strong>.
</p></li></ul><p>Extra credit may also be awarded to students who submit work which
went way beyond what was expected.  This will be initiated by us; if
you ask for it, you probably do not qualify.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Attendance</h2><ul><li><p>During some random classes, I will take attendance of some
    random selection of students.  This may be done multiple
    times within a single class.
</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>You may have up to one unexcused absence without any penalty
    in the semester.
</p></li><li><p>You will loose 1 point for the second unexcused absence.
</p></li><li><p>You will loose 3 points for each subsequent unexcused absence
    up to a maximum of -16 points.
</p></li><li><p>An absence will be excused if you 
    <a href="mailto:umrigar+cs551@binghamton.edu">send me an email</a> <strong>before class</strong>
    giving me a reason for the absence.  I may require documentation
    for the reason.  
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Assignment of Final Letter Grades</h2><ul><li><p>Letter grades will be assigned strictly monotonically based on
      the numeric course grade.
</p></li><li><p>No fixed cutoffs: they will be determined jointly by myself and
      the TA.
</p></li><li><p>The cutoffs will not be published.  This avoids issues caused by
      some students attempting to game the system by requesting
      regrading if they feel they just missed a cutoff.
</p></li><li><p>A letter grade of A will be only be given for consistent
      superior work.
</p></li><li><p>You will get an F only if you miss turning in a lot of work
      or submit consistently very poor quality work.
</p></li><li><p>If you have an issue with the grading of a particular assignment, it
      is <strong>imperative</strong> that you see the grader before the final exam.
</p></li><li><p>All assigned letter grades are final unless there is some kind
      of clerical error.  <strong>Do not send emails</strong> requesting a different
      letter grade unless there has been a clerical error.
</p></li><li><p>Details for 
      <a href="../../misc/course-grading/course-grading.html">Course Grading</a> are available.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Academic Honesty</h2><p>  As per the course
  
  <a href="../../misc/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy.html">Academic Honesty Policy</a> cheating of any type will be penalized
  heavily.
</p><ul><li><p>Minimal penalty: zero on assignment and letter grade dropped by
      one slot: i.e. an A becomes an A-, a B- becomes a C+, etc.  You
      will also need to sign a Watson College document which will be
      added to your file.
</p></li><li><p>Permissible to collaborate to understand course material,
      homework questions or project assignments. <strong>Not permissible to
      discuss solutions.</strong>
</p><ul><li><p>If you feel you may have inadvertently crossed the line, then
        let us know; will not be considered cheating.
</p></li><li><p>If submitting an assignment late after the solution has been
        posted, you should obviously not be looking at the solution.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>All registered students must sign and complete an
      
      <a href="../../misc/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-statement.html">Academic Honesty Statement.</a>
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Use of AI Tools</h2><ul><li><p>AI tools will be an important part of your professional toolbox.
</p></li><li><p>It is not possible to restrict the use of AI tools.  Instead, they
    may be used judiciously.
</p></li><li><p>If you use AI tools, use them to only supplement your understanding.
</p></li><li><p>Since AI tools can produce incorrect or suboptimal results, it is
    not a good idea to use them when you are not familiar with the
    material.
</p></li><li><p>It will not be possible to use AI tools during the midterm and
    final since the use of electronic devices is not permitted.  Hence
    you will need to understand the material in order to obtain a
    decent grade.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Late Submission Policy</h2><ul><li><p>You are allowed to submit projects and homework late by up to 3
    days.

      subscribed to the 
      <a href="mailto:cs-451-551-umrigar@cs.binghamton.edu">CS551</a> mailing list.
</p></li><li><p>To change the email address via which you are subscribed to the
      list or would like to edit your subscription options, please
      visit this
      
      <a href="https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/mailman/listinfo/cs-451-551-umrigar">list maintenance page</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Feel free to use the mailing list for general discussion/questions
      relevant to the course.
</p></li><li><p><strong>DO NOT</strong> use the mailing list to send emails to me specific to
      your personal situation.  Use
      
      <a href="mailto:umrigar+cs551@binghamton.edu">umrigar+cs551@binghamton.edu</a> instead.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>   <span id="personal-emails">Personal</span> Emails</h2><ul><li><p>Please  <a href="mailto:umrigar+cs551@binghamton.edu">email me</a> if you
    have a non-technical personal situation.
</p></li><li><p>If emailing your TA re. a grading issue, please CC me.
</p></li><li><p>For technical questions, please email both me and the course TAs.
</p></li><li><p>Be as specific as possible in your question.
</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not send screenshots of code</strong>.  Doing so makes it impossible
    to cut-and-paste the code.  Instead, include your code as <strong>text</strong>
    within your email.
</p></li><li><p>Do not send code for an entire project or function.  Instead,
    create a
    
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible example</a> which demonstrates the problem you
    are facing.  In my experience, attempting to create such an
    example will often result in your resolving the problem without
    any assistance.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Virtual Machines</h2><ul><li><p>Once course enrollments have stabilized, each student will be
    assigned a Linux-based virtual machine which can be used for
    course projects and other related work.
</p></li><li><p>Each VM comes preinstalled with all the software needed for the
    course. If you prefer to use your own computing environment, a
    list of installed software is 
    <a href="../../misc/vm-setup/setup.sh">available.</a> <strong>However, it is your responsibility to ensure that
    submitted code runs within your VM environment</strong>.
</p></li><li><p>Each student has <code>sudo</code> access to their VM.  This makes it
    possible for the student to install any other required software.
</p></li><li><p>Imperative that students
     <a href="/bing-cs-docs/remote-access/remote-access.html">set up GUI
    access</a> to their VM as that will be needed for subsequent
    projects.  The recommended software is x2go.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Classes</h2><ul><li><p>You are not allowed to use personal electronic devices like
    laptops or cell-phones during lectures (you must however bring a
    laptop to class in order to take pop quizzes).
</p></li><li><p>If in-person classes are canceled by the university due to
    weather, the class will be held at the regular time on
     <a href="https://binghamton.zoom.us/my/umrigar">zoom.</a>
</p></li><li><p>If for some reason, I am unable to teach a class in-person, the
    class will be held at the regular time on
     <a href="https://binghamton.zoom.us/my/umrigar">zoom</a> after posting an
    announcement.
</p></li><li><p>If you are feeling unwell, you should not attend class.
</p></li><li><p>In the event that you are unable to attend class, you should
    inform me <strong>before</strong> the class.  If you have a valid excuse and
    there is a pop quiz, you will be allowed to make up the quiz.
</p></li><li><p>Multiple absences will require documentation.
</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To accomodate students having excused absences, all classes
    will be streamed on  <a href="https://binghamton.zoom.us/my/umrigar">zoom.</a>
</p></li><li><p>Links to recordings of the zoom sessions will be made available on
    the course website in  <a href="../../misc/videos">misc/videos.</a>
