</p><p><strong>Important Reminder</strong>: As per the course

<a href="../../misc/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy.html">Academic Honesty Policy</a>, cheating of any kind will minimally
result in your letter grade for the entire course being reduced by one
level.
</p><p>This document first provides the aims of this project.  It then lists
the requirements as explicitly as possible.  It then hints at how
these requirements can be met.  Finally, it describes how it can be
submitted.
</p><section data-level="h2"><h2>Aims</h2><p>The aims of this project are as follows:
</p><ul><li><p>To expose you to advanced C programming.
</p></li><li><p>To design and implement an ADT.
</p></li><li><p>To introduce you to the issues involved in manually managing
    dynamic memory.
</p></li><li><p>To start building a chat application (which will be fleshed out
    in subsequent projects).
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="require">Requirements</span></h2><p>Submit a  <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/zip">zip</a>-archive which
unpacks into a <code>prj1-sol</code> directory containing a <code>Makefile</code> such that
typing <code>make</code> in that directory will implement the specifications
provided in  <a href="./prj1-sol/chat-io.h">chat-io.h.</a>
</p><p>The <code>prj1-sol</code> directory must contain a <code>README</code> documenting
the details of your project submission, including the contact
information for both team members.
</p><p>You are required to design an I/O independent specification for a chat
ADT and provide both a specification and implementation file.
</p><p>The program should not have any hardcoded limits on the size of inputs
beyond those dictated by the availability of memory.  It should ensure
that all allocated memory is freed before a success exit.
</p><p>You are not allowed to use any libraries other than <code>libc</code>.
</p><p>An annotated  <a href="extras/LOG?lang=sh">log</a> of the running project and the
 <a href="extras/tests">provided tests</a> should help clarify the above
requirements.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Provided Files</h2><p>The  <a href="./prj1-sol">prj1-sol</a> directory contains starter files as well as
a template README which you must complete and include with your
submission.
</p><dl><dt>  <a href="prj1-sol/chat-io.h">chat-io.h</a> </dt><dd><p>    A specification file providing the specifications for
    the <code>chat_io()</code> function you are required to implement.
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="prj1-sol/chat-io.c">chat-io.c</a> </dt><dd><p>    A skeleton file which provides a <code>main()</code> function for the entire
    program and an empty implementation for the <code>chat_io()</code> function
    which you are required to implement.
</p><p>    You will need to flesh out the <code>chat_io()</code> function.
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="prj1-sol/chat.h">chat.h</a> </dt><dd><p>    A skeleton file which is essentially empty.  You will fill this
    in with a specification for your chat ADT.
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="prj1-sol/chat.c">chat.c</a> </dt><dd><p>    A skeleton file in which you should implement the ADT
    specified in the <code>chat.h</code>.

    from an input stream.  You should not need to modify these files.
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="prj1-sol/errnum.h">errnum.h</a> and  <a href="prj1-sol/errnum.c">errnum.c</a> </dt><dd><p>    A specification and implementation for error codes.  The
    implementation file simply provides a function for translating
    integer error codes into strings.
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="prj1-sol/Makefile">Makefile</a> </dt><dd><p>    A <code>Makefile</code> for the 
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/">make</a> build tool.  You should not need to modify this file as long
    as you use the same project structure as outlined above.
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="./prj1-sol/README">README</a></dt><dd><p>    A README file which must be submitted along with your project.  It
    contains an initial header which you must complete (replace the
    dummy entries with your name, B-number and email address at which
    you would like to receive project-related email).  After the
    header you may include any content which you would like read
    during the grading of your project.

        contain error message lines starting with a <code>:</code>-terminated error
    	code prefix.
</p></dd><dt> <code>*.out</code> </dt><dd><p>        A file containing the expected output for the corresponding

    	code prefixes.
</p></dd></dl></dd><dt>  <a href="extras/do-tests.sh?lang=sh">do-tests.sh</a> </dt><dd><p>    A shell script which can be used for running the above tests.
    It can be invoked from any directory and takes up to two arguments:
</p><ol><li><p>The path to your <code>run.sh</code> shell script.  
</p></li><li><p>An optional argument giving the path to a single test
         to be run.
</p></li></ol><p>    If invoked with only a single argument, the script will run
    all tests.  If invoked with a second argument, then it will
    run only the test specified by that argument.
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="extras/LOG?lang=sh">LOG</a> </dt><dd><p>    An annotated log file illustrating the interactive operation of the project.
</p></dd></dl><p>Additionally, you are also being provided with a <code>cs551</code> library in
 <a href="../../lib">lib</a> with the sources files in 
<a href="../../src/libcs551">src/libcs551.</a>  This library provides 
<a href="../../include/memalloc.h">checked wrappers</a> for <code>malloc()</code> and friends, as well as
 <a href="../../include/errors.h">simple functions</a> for printing errors and a
 <a href="../../include/trace.h">trace utility</a> triggered by a preprocessor
macro <code>DO_TRACE</code>.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="design">Design</span> Considerations</h2><p>It is clear that your application will need to track individual chat
messages.  If using a language like Java, one approach might use a
declaration like:
</p><pre class="hljs language-java">class ChatMsg {
  String user;
  String room;
  String[] topics;
  String message;
  ...
}

class Chats {
  //some kind of collection of ChatMsg's.
  List&lt;ChatMsg> chats;
  ...
}
</pre><p>A trivial difference for a C implementation is that it would use a
<code>struct</code> rather than a <code>class</code>.  There are more substantial
differences with respect to manual memory allocation:
</p><ul><li><p>Memory has to be allocated for the <code>user</code>, <code>room</code> and <code>message</code>
    strings.
</p></li><li><p>Memory has to be allocated for the <code>topics</code> array as well as for the
    strings within that array.
</p></li><li><p>The <code>chat</code> collection has to be implemented manually.
</p></li></ul><p>First we consider possiblities for the <code>ChatMsg</code> <code>struct</code> before
considering possibilities for the collection.
</p><section data-level="h3"><h3>The Chat Message Structure</h3><p>The possibilities include structures which have a size known at
compile time and other structures which have a size which will be
known only at runtime.
</p><ol><li><p><strong>A separate malloc() for each piece of dynamic data</strong>
</p><pre class="hljs language-c">    typedef struct {
      const char *user;     //pointer to user string.
      const char *room;     //pointer to room string.
      const char **topics;  //pointer to array of topic strings
      const char *message;  //pointer to message string.
    } ChatMsg;
</pre><p>    In this case, the <code>user</code>, <code>room</code> and <code>message</code> would each be a
    pointer to a <code>malloc()</code>ed area having sizes <code>strlen(user) + 1</code>,
    <code>strlen(room) + 1</code> and <code>strlen(message) + 1</code> respectively (the <code>+
    1</code> accounts for the necessary terminating <code>NUL</code> character).  If
    there are <code>n</code> topics, then <code>topics</code> will be a pointer to an
    <code>n</code>-element <code>char *</code> array, where each element of the array will
    be a pointer to a topic string.
</p><p>    This organization will require multiple allocations for each
    chat message:
</p><ol><li><p>A <code>malloc()</code> for the <code>user</code> string.
</p></li><li><p>A <code>malloc()</code> for the <code>room</code> string.
</p></li><li><p>A <code>malloc()</code> for the <code>message</code> string.
</p></li><li><p>A <code>malloc()</code> for the <code>n</code>-element <code>topics</code> array.
</p></li><li><p>A <code>malloc()</code> for each of <code>n</code> <code>topics</code> string.
</p></li><li><p>A <code>malloc()</code> for the overall <code>ChatMsg</code> structure.
</p></li></ol><p>    This will result in a total of <code>5 + n</code> <code>malloc()</code>'s.
</p><p>    The size of this structure will be known at compile time but the
    data for a single chat message may be scattered all over memory.
</p></li><li><p><strong>A single malloc()</strong>
</p><pre class="hljs language-c">    typedef struct {
      const char *user;    //pointer to user string within buf[].
      const char *room;    //pointer to room string within buf[].
      const char *topics;  //pointer to topics[0] string within buf[].
      const char *message; //pointer to message string within buf[].
      char buf[];          //flexi array big enough for all chat strings
    } ChatMsg;
</pre><p>    The size of the <code>buf[]</code> array would depend on the size of the
    strings in the message; <code>user</code>, <code>room</code> and <code>message</code> would point
    within <code>buf[]</code>; <code>topics</code> would also be a pointer within <code>buf[]</code>
    pointing to the first <code>topic</code> string.  Subsequent <code>topic</code> strings
    can be found after the terminating <code>NUL</code> character after the
    previous <code>topic</code> string.
</p><p>    We will need to have:
</p>\[    \begin{array}{rl}
    \texttt{sizeof(buf)} = &amp;(\texttt{strlen(user)} + 1) \\
                         + &amp;(\texttt{strlen(room)} + 1) \\
                         + &amp;(\texttt{strlen(message)} + 1) \\
			 + &amp;\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\texttt{strlen(topics[i])} + 1)
    \end{array}			 
\]<p>    The single <code>malloc()</code> would simply allocate <code>sizeof(ChatMsg) +
    sizeof(buf)</code> bytes.  This size of this cannot be determined until
    runtime, but all the data for a single <code>ChatMsg</code> will be in
    contiguous memory.
</p></li><li><p><strong>A single malloc() using indexes instead of pointers</strong>
</p><p>    This would be almost the same as the previous alternative,
    but would use indexes into <code>buf[]</code> rather than pointers.
    This would make it easier to serialize <code>ChatMsg</code> across
    a network.
</p><pre class="hljs language-c">    typedef struct {
      const size_t user;    //index of user string within buf[].
      const size_t room;    //index of room string within buf[].
      const size_t topics;  //index of topics[0] string within buf[].
      const size_t message; //index of message string within buf[].
      char buf[];           //flexi array big enough for all chat strings
    } ChatMsg;
</pre><p>    Considerations about the size of the <code>buf[]</code> array would be
    identical to the previous alternative.
</p></li><li><p><strong>Shared user, room and topic strings</strong>
</p><p>    This could use either of the above two approaches, but instead
    of storing the same <code>user</code> string for each <code>ChatMsg</code> in which it appears,
    we would store the <code>user</code> string only once and share that string
    among multiple <code>ChatMsg</code> structures.  Similarly for <code>room</code>, and
    the <code>topics</code> strings.
</p><p>    This approach would be more memory efficient than the previous
    approaches, but would require keeping some kind of dynamically
    allocated string space to store the shared strings.
</p></li></ol></section><section data-level="h3"><h3>The <code>chat</code> Collection</h3><p>Possibilities for implementing the <code>chat</code> collection include
a linked-list and a dynamically grown vector.  Tradeoffs:
</p><ul><li><p>If chats are added at the front of the linked list,
    then addition of a new chat, or retrieving the last
    \(n\) chats becomes very easy.
</p></li><li><p>A vector where each element stores a <code>ChatMsg</code> directly is
    possible only if <code>sizeof(ChatMsg)</code> is known at compile time.
    OTOH, if <code>sizeof(ChatMsg)</code> is known only at runtime, then each
    element of a vector would necessarily need to be a pointer to a
    <code>ChatMsg</code>.
</p></li><li><p>For a linked list, if <code>sizeof(ChatMsg)</code> is known only at runtime,
    then each node of the list either needs to contain a pointer to a
    <code>ChatMsg</code> or the node should be laid out such that the pointer to
    the next node of the list appear before the variable sized
    <code>ChatMsg</code>.
</p></li></ul><p>Note that the handle used for accessing all chats will typically be
a pointer to the <code>struct</code> implementing this collection.
</p></section></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Hints</h2><p>This section is not prescriptive in that you may choose to ignore
it as long as you meet all the project requirements.
</p><p>The following points are worth noting:
</p><ul><li><p>While developing the project, you will probably be running
    tests provided in the  <a href="extras">extras</a> directory.  It may
    be convenient to set up a shortcut shell variable in the
    shell you are using for developing your project.
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ extras=$HOME/cs551/projects/prj1/extras
    # run a particular test
    $ $extras/do-tests.sh ./chat $extras/tests/02-basic.test
    # run all tests
    $ $extras/do-tests.sh ./chat
</pre></li><li><p>You will need to perform dynamic memory allocation for
    implementing your <code>chat</code> ADT.  It will not be possible to use the
     <a href="../../include/memalloc.h">checked allocation wrappers</a> from the
    <code>cs551</code> library as they will terminate your program.  Hence your
    ADT will need to return any memory allocation errors to its
    client; typically this will be done by setting an error code via a
    <code>ErrNum *errnum</code> pointer.
</p></li><li><p>An example memory allocation within an ADT function will 
    look something like the following:
</p><pre class="hljs language-c">    SomeReturnType
    SomeADTFn(..., ErrNum *err, ...)
    {
      ...
      const char *msg = ... ;
      char *msgCopy = malloc(strlen(msg) + 1);
      if (!msgCopy) { *err = MEM_ERR; return ... ; }
      strcpy(msgCopy, msg);
      ...
    }
</pre></li><li><p>An allocation for something like the topics array within an ADT
    function will look something like the following:
</p><pre class="hljs language-c">    SomeReturnType
    SomeADTFn(..., ErrNum *err, ...)
    {
      ...
      size_t nTopics = ... ;
      const char *topics[] = ... ;
      char *topicsCopy = malloc(nTopics * sizeof(char *));
      if (!topicsCopy) { *err = MEM_ERR; return ... ; }
      //foreach i in [0, nTopics), initialized  topicsCopy[i] to
      //point to freshly allocated copy of topics[i]
      ...
    }
</pre></li><li><p>The GNU
    
    <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcasecmp.3.html">strcasecmp()</a> library function may be useful for comparing strings.
</p></li><li><p>The <code>stpcpy_lc()</code> function in the  <a href="../../slides/advanced-c/code/linked-list/linked-list.c">linked-list.c</a> implementation discussed in class may be useful
    for copying strings while converting to lower-case.
</p></li><li><p>Look into debugging possibilities.  I use 
    <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/">gdb;</a> if using VS Code, you should be able to set it up for debugging
    C code.
</p><p>    When all else fails, use the provided  <a href="../../include/trace.h">TRACE</a>
    macro or insert <code>printf()</code> statements.
</p></li></ul><p>You may proceed as follows:
</p><ol><li><p>Make sure that your VM is set up as per the
      <a href="../../misc/vm-setup/vm-setup.html">instructions.</a>
</p></li><li><p>The vanilla installation on the VM does not include
     <a href="https://valgrind.org/">valgrind.</a>  Go ahead and install it using
    <code>snap</code>:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    sudo snap install --classic valgrind
</pre><p>    You will need to provide your VM password.
</p></li><li><p>Copy over the provided <code>prj1-sol</code> directory to your <code>i551/submit</code>
    directory (both of them should exist if you have set up your VM as
     <a href="../../misc/vm-setup/vm-setup.html">instructed).</a>
</p><pre class="hljs language-c">    $ cd ~/i551/submit
    $ cp -r ~/cs551/projects/prj1/prj1-sol .
</pre></li><li><p>You should be able to build and run the project from within your
    working <code>i551/submit/prj1-sol</code> directory:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ make
      ...
    $ ./chat
    $
</pre><p>    Of course, the project will not do anything until you implement
    the <code>chat_io()</code> function.
</p></li><li><p>Fill in the <code>README</code> template and commit all your changes to github.
</p></li><li><p>Review the  <a href="../../slides/advanced-c/advanced-c.html">material</a> in
    the slides.  In particular, review the code for the
    
    <a href="../../slides/advanced-c/advanced-c.html#linked-list">linked-list ADT</a> as well as code for the
    
    <a href="../../slides/advanced-c/advanced-c.html#coll-interfaces">multiple collection interfaces</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Make sure you understand the  <a href="prj1-sol/chat-io.h">specifications</a>
    for this project. Make sure you also understand the difference
    between <strong>system errors</strong> and <strong>user errors</strong>.
</p><p>    Also be sure to understand the provided  <a href="prj1-sol/msgargs.h">msgargs</a>
    module.  It can be used to take care of all the low-level input needed
    by your project.
</p></li><li><p>Review the  <a href="#design">Design Considerations</a> and come up with
    a design.
</p></li><li><p>Both team members should cooperatively update 
    <a href="prj1-sol/chat.h">chat.h</a> to specify an ADT for a <code>chat</code> object.  Requirements
    for the ADT:
</p><ul><li><p>It should not be overly general but just provide the
        functionality needed for this project.
</p></li><li><p>The details of the implementation must be hidden by
        the ADT.  This can be done by declaring the ADT type
	using an incomplete <code>struct</code> in the <code>chat.h</code> specification
	file and completing that <code>struct</code> in the <code>chat.c</code> implementation
	file.
</p><p>	It should be possible to change the implementation to use a
	different design without needing to change the ADT
	specification.
</p></li><li><p>It should not do <strong>any</strong> I/O.
</p></li><li><p>It should not detect any user errors.
</p></li><li><p>It can report system errors back to the caller using a simple
        <code>errNum</code> pointer (like in the
        
        <a href="../../slides/advanced-c/advanced-c.html#coll-interfaces">example interface</a> covered in class).
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Given the above ADT, both members of the team can subsequently
    work quite independently.
</p><ul><li><p>One team member should complete the implementation of the
        <code>chat_io()</code> function in  <a href="prj1-sol/chat-io.c">chat-io.c</a> using
        the ADT designed in the previous step.  This implementation
        must do <strong>all</strong> checking for user errors, thus ensuring that the
        ADT can ignore them.
</p></li><li><p>The other team member should complete the implementation
        of the <code>chat</code> ADT in the <code>chat.c</code> file.
</p></li></ul><p>    It is entirely possible that the specification of the ADT
    will need to change as the project is understood better.
</p></li><li><p>Test your program interactively using the <code>main()</code> function
    provided in the skeleton  <a href="prj1-sol/chat-io.c">chat-io.c</a>
    function as in the provided  <a href="extras/LOG?lang=sh">LOG.</a>
</p><p>    The <code>main()</code> function will provide <code>&quot;> &quot;</code> as a prompt to your
    <code>chat_io()</code> function when it is run interactively; otherwise it
    will provide <code>&quot;&quot;</code> as the prompt.  Hence a correct implementation
    of the <code>chat_io()</code> function should display a <code>&quot;> &quot;</code> prompt before
    each chat command when used interactively.
</p></li><li><p>Run the provided tests.
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ ~/cs551/projects/prj1/extras/do-tests.sh ./chat
</pre><p>    Debug any failing tests.  Note that you can run a single test by
    adding an additional argument to the above command providing the
    path to the failing test.
</p></li><li><p>Check for memory allocation failures by running the program using
    <code>valgrind</code>.
</p><p>    For example, the following will check whether a NOP-chat cleans
    up after itself:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ valgrind ./chat
    ... lots of valgrind messages ...
    ...
    # interactive chat prompt, type ^D for EOF
    >
    ... lots more valgrind messages ...
    ...
</pre><p>    If the memory is cleaned up you should see something like:
</p><pre>    All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
</pre><p>    If you get memory errors, then debug and fix.
</p></li><li><p>Check for memory allocation failures for each of the provided
    tests:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ for t in ~/cs551/projects/prj1/extras/tests/*.test; \
      do \
        valgrind ./chat $t ; \
      done      
</pre></li><li><p>Iterate until you meet all requirements.
</p></li></ol><p>It is always a good idea to keep committing your project periodically
to git to ensure that you do not accidentally lose work.
</p><p>The submission procedure will be provided after Sep 10 once the TA
arrives.
